# Cybersecurity-and-Network-Analysis-Portfolio-
I have successfully completed coursework in Ethical Hacking, Penetration Testing, and Network Traffic Analysis. These courses have equipped me with practical skills in cybersecurity, including threat identification, network analysis, vulnerability assessment, and the use of tools like Wireshark for packet analysis. I have a strong understanding of various cybersecurity concepts, such as ARP Spoofing, DoS and DDoS attacks, and frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK and the Cyber Kill Chain. This coursework has enhanced my ability to contribute to cybersecurity efforts and protect digital assets.
